I'm an interdisciplinary climate scientist helping inform climate impacts projections and decision-making under uncertainty. I'm currently a [Columbia Climate School Postdoc](https://www.climate.columbia.edu/postdoctoral-research-program), working with Radley Horton and Gernot Wagner on uncertainty in projections of climate impacts, especially in high-risk, data-sparse regions. I recently defended my PhD in Earth and Environmental Sciences from Columbia University, having worked with Richard Seager (and previously [Lisa Goddard](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/22/climate/lisa-goddard-dead.html)) at Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory and the International Research Institute for Climate and Society ([IRI](iri.columbia.edu)). 

I've studied the drivers of the long and short rains in East Africa, internal variability in climate models, and the sensitivity of climate impact projections to uncertainty in climate data. I've [found](https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.2208095119) that climate impact projections need to incorporate the 'internal' variability of the climate to avoid underestimating tail risks, that both oceanic and atmospheric biases are [causing](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00382-022-06622-5) climate models to poorly simuate the rainfall in East Africa, but also that better understanding the region's fundamental dynamics [can help us](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/clim/aop/JCLI-D-23-0126.1/JCLI-D-23-0126.1.xml) better prepare for the future. 

I've [co-written](https://climateestimate.net/content/getting-started.html) a tutorial on using climate data in climate econometrics. I've taught lessons and seminars on climate projections and climate change at the middle school, high school, undergraduate, and master's level. I write python and R packages such as [this one](https://github.com/ks905383/xagg) on aggregating gridded data onto geographic regions or [this one](https://github.com/ks905383/quantproj) that uses the delta method to bias-correct and downscale Large Ensemble projections. I care about open-source data, replicability, and democratization of science tools, and I believe [science is a social enterprise](https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2019/10/in-why-trust-science-naomi-oreskes-explains-why-the-process-of-proof-is-worth-trusting/) that works better when it's diverse, open, and accessible. I run [NENSIC](nensic.org), an interdisciplinary network to bring together students and young professionals interested in climate issues from any background. 

I'm a Paris-born Austrian who's also felt at home in Los Angeles, Chicago, Beijing, and New York. I [play](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bi-4AVCgX_J/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&igshid=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==) and [record](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5SlQZFaXKp20BLHEvn1yp6?si=bee6e9b904e64e27) violin tracks from roots to rock to hip hop.
